# Documentation index

Read [coordination](COORDINATION.md) once at task start, then choose the active
stage below. This index is a router, not a required reading list. Existing runtime
configuration does not require rereading installation guides.

| Active task | Read now |
| --- | --- |
| Code or documentation | [Git workflow](GIT_WORKFLOW.md), the affected interface/tests |
| New or resumed reconstruction | [Acceptance intake](WORKFLOW_ACCEPTANCE.md#declare-scope-before-downstream-work), current scene/task state, [scene skill](../.agents/skills/indoor-scene-workflow/SKILL.md) |
| Room, furniture or material edit | [Blender RoomKit](../.agents/skills/blender-roomkit/SKILL.md); its references only for the operation being performed |
| Source-person reconstruction | [Motion policy](MOTION_CONTROLS.md), [GVHMR skill](../.agents/skills/gvhmr-body-reconstruction/SKILL.md) |
| Launch or resume a long job | [Execution policy](RENDER_EXECUTION.md), [runtime policy](../MACHINE.md) |
| Publish a scene/demo | [Acceptance](WORKFLOW_ACCEPTANCE.md), [results](RESULTS.md) |
| Configure or repair an environment | [Setup](SETUP.md), the relevant component's installation guide |

Each policy has one maintained authority: ownership in coordination, synchronization
in Git workflow, job waits in render execution, motion defaults in motion controls,
and acceptance in workflow acceptance. Skills link to these policies; historical
lessons and experiment reports do not change defaults. User instructions take
precedence. When editing a policy, update conflicting entrypoints in the same change.

The historical lessons retain methodological observations but exclude their
scene files and videos. Missing evidence references are recorded explicitly in
`omitted_references.json`; do not treat these historical reports as a fresh run.
